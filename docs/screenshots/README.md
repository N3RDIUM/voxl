# Screenshots
Dated (DD/MM/YYYY) screenshots, last-come-first-serve. [Go back to the top-level README](../../README.md)

![Textured cube](./3_textured_cube.png)

01/01/2026: First textured cube, plus imgui integration for debugging.

![First cube](./2_first_cube.png)

31/01/2026: First cube, with a controllable player (FPS camera controls).

![Scene graph implementation with face culling](./1_quad_graph_cull.png)

28/01/2026: Not very visually different from the last screenshot, but this one
is being rendered using a shiny new scene graph implementation. Also, less quads
are visible because face culling was enabled in the OpenGL renderer.

![Quad rendering test](./0_quad_render_test.png)

26/01/2026: First light! Rendering 16384 `Quad`s using the OpenGL backend.
